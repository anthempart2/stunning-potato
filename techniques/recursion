class Main{
    static void printNos(int n){
        if(n>15) return;

    }
    
    public static void main(String args[]){
        printNos(1);
    }
}

//we used 'static' for printNos because only a static method can be called only by another static method; main() is static

//we used 'void' even though its giving an output because its printing nos != returning nos

//() is used to call methods, not for classes, hence we begin with Main{} but continue with printNos()
