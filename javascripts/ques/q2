#Question
Write a function once(fn) such that:

> It takes one function as an argument
> It returns a new function

The returned function:
> Calls fn only the first time
> On later calls, it should not call fn again
> It should return the result from the first call every time

#Code
function once(fn){
    let called= false;
    let result;
    
    return function(){
        if(!called){
            return fn();
            called = true;
        }
        return result;
    };
}
